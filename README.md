# qr_hunter
a quick and dirty tool to record QR code details, time, date and location metadata.

I've added an tool to creae a timeline if you import the json file: hunter_timeline.html

use at own risk. this is just a fling to help me do some research wihtout having to write down anything, I can just scan codes and save the JSON. Easy Peasy.
